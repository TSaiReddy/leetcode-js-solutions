# Algorithms and Data Structures JavaScript Solutions

This repository contains JavaScript solutions for various algorithms and data structure problems. Each file corresponds to a specific problem, and the following is a brief description of each with links:

**[best_time_to_buy_and_sell_stock_121.js](best_time_to_buy_and_sell_stock_121.js)**

- Problem: Find the best time to buy and sell stock to maximize profit.

**[climbing_stairs_70.js](climbing_stairs_70.js)**

- Problem: You are climbing a staircase. It takes n steps to reach the top. Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

**[contains_duplicate_217.js](contains_duplicate_217.js)**

- Problem: Given an integer array nums, return true if any value appears at least twice in the array, and return false if every element is distinct.

**[find_first_and_last_position_of_ele_in_sorted_arr_34.js](find_first_and_last_position_of_ele_in_sorted_arr_34.js)**

- Problem: Find the starting and ending position of a target element in a sorted array.

**[find_the_duplicate_number_287.js](find_the_duplicate_number_287.js)**

- Problem: Find the duplicate number in an array containing n+1 integers where each integer is between 1 and n.

**[guess_num_high_or_low_374.js](guess_num_high_or_low_374.js)**

- Problem: Implement a game where you guess a number and receive feedback on whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct.

**[house_robber_198.js](house_robber_198.js)**

- Problem: Given an integer array nums representing the amount of money of each house, return the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight without alerting the police

**[median_of_2_sorted_arr_4.js](median_of_2_sorted_arr_4.js)**

- Problem: Find the median of two sorted arrays.

**[merge_sorted_arr_88.js](merge_sorted_arr_88.js)**

- Problem: Merge two sorted arrays into a single sorted array.

**[product_of_arr_except_self_238.js](product_of_arr_except_self_238.js)**

- Problem: Calculate the product of an array except for the element at each index.

**[remove_dup_from_sorted_arr_II_80.js](remove_dup_from_sorted_arr_II_80.js)**

- Problem: Remove duplicates from a sorted array, allowing at most two duplicates for each element.

**[reverse_words_in_a_string_151.js](reverse_words_in_a_string_151.js)**

- Problem: A word is defined as a sequence of non-space characters. The words in s will be separated by at least one space.Return a string of the words in reverse order concatenated by a single space.

**[single_ele_in_a_sorted_arr_540.js](single_ele_in_a_sorted_arr_540.js)**

- Problem: Given a sorted array consisting of only integers where every element appears exactly twice, except for one element which appears exactly once. return the single element that appears only once.

**[single_number_136.js](single_number_136.js)**

- Problem: Given a non-empty array of integers nums, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.

**[string_comp_443.js](string_comp_443.js)**

- Problem: Compress a string by replacing repeated characters with their count.

**[unq_num_of_occurrences_1207.js](unq_num_of_occurrences_1207.js)**

- Problem: Check if the number of occurrences of each element in an array is unique.
